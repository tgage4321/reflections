What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
- It is how you start a new repository. If you run this command a new repository is made that you can add and remove files to or edit to make a new software project. I guess you need to do it to start a repository? Seems like a trick question a little bit...

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
- Well the staging area is basically a list of files that are going to be part of the next commit. So, they include some or all of the files in the working directory and reflect what is going to be in the repository at the next commit. It adds values as you can control exactly which files you want in each commit. You might not want to include all files in the directory for certain reasons, although personally I am not sure why you would want to do that too much.
